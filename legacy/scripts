# Legacy Scripts

These scripts were developed during the early stages of the ZK-V2XChain framework.  
They include prototype simulations, visualizations, and smart contract logic used for initial testing.  
They were refined during development and are retained here for reference.  
Current simulation and analysis workflows are maintained in `scripts/ablation/` and `scripts/analysis/`.
